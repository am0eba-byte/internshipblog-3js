                    <p class="post">It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon that I entered the office
                        building. With a bundle of paperclips cinching the too-loose waistline of my
                        slacks, which I haphazardly purchased the week before, I remarked on the
                        monumentousness of the day. My supervisor, Dan, gave me a tour of the
                        building, introducing me to my new coworkers at their posts as we made our
                        rounds about the office quarters. He gave me a plate of pumpkin cookies to
                        entice my fellow Larsonians to come introduce themselves at my desk
                        throughout the day. I attended my first Arjuna team meeting in the outdoor
                        courtyard area, where my software development team introduced themselves and
                        exchanged little stories of their lives leading up to Larson. I was
                        acquainted with the equipment available to me at my new work desk, including
                        my work PC, my work email, etc. Alan, the wizard of programming code, had
                        another private meeting with Dan and I later in the day to acquaint me with
                        the details, scope, and logistics of the company quest at hand: Arjuna. As I
                        currently understand it, our software development team is tasked with
                        creating Arjuna to provide a platform on which teachers and students
                        throughout the country may access Larson textbook resources, lessons, and
                        materials through a user interface designed to tailor specifically to the
                        state the users are in, the corresponding state standard competencies that
                        are required for teachers to give to students, and keep a record of how the
                        students are progressing with the material. This involves creating multiple
                        layers of structured API which integrate State Core Competencies, Larson's
                        Learning Resources, and the relationships between them. In short: it's a
                        friggen huge adventure, and now I'm in it.</p>

                    <p class="post"> Now marks the end of my second week, and I'm already beginning
                        to feel more confident about my general existence at this fine institution.
                        My feelings of repressive shyness and uncertainty have almost entirely
                        subsided, and I'm firmly grasping the project's overall structure, goals,
                        and the things I can contribute to the software code. Alan introduced me to
                        the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and sent me on my way
                        exploring the software devs' database of choice for this project: Arango DB.
                        I've begun using Arango's tools to create a JSON schema for the
                            <i>competencies</i> dataset, which is turning out to be an adventure in
                        its own right - involving copious amounts of Googling. Alan said once this
                        first schema is written and in proper order, writing the other schemas for
                        the rest of the datasets will be a piece of cake. Except the cake will be
                        avocado flavored with javascript object notation icing on top. </p>

                    <p class="post"> Week three was the week of data validation reckoning, it seems.
                        On Tuesday, I Googled and JSON-schema-ed my little heart out to create some
                        well-formed code which validated the rules for each object within the
                        competencies dataset of Arjuna... for the most part. The schema did the job
                        in that it prevented incorrect data inputs for each object property, for
                        example, if an object <span class="code">"Token"</span> has a key-value pair
                        where <span class="code">{"type": "string"}</span>, any data inputs entered
                        into that object that are not a string (a number, a boolean, null, etc.)
                        would be rejected. This was all well and good for <i>object</i> data, but we
                        ran into some trouble with data that contained an <i>array</i>. For
                        example:</p>

                    <div class="code"> "Definition": { "type": "array", "items": { "language":
                        {"type": "string"}, "text": {"type": "string"} } } </div>

                    <p class="post"> A <span class="code">"Definition"</span> object contained an
                        array of two property types, <span class="code">"language"</span> and <span
                            class="code">"text"</span>. The <span class="code">"language"</span>
                        property is set to only be allowed to contain a <span class="code"
                            >"string"</span>, but in the competencies data, the language inputs
                        conform to the ISO language keywords - such as <span class="code"
                            >"en-US"</span> for American English or <span class="code"
                            >"es-US"</span> for American Spanish. Setting the data type property as
                            <span class="code">"string"</span> is not specific enough to prevent any
                        strings other than the ISO language codes Arjuna uses from occurring within
                        the <span class="code">"language"</span> property. Since JSON Schema is such
                        a new language, there hasn't been documentation or rules created to make
                        string datatypes be more specific. </p>
                    <p class="post">As I continued battle-testing my schema, I realized a major
                        issue with JSON schema's limited data validation powers: since JSON Schema's
                        syntax does not include code that can define how many times an array can
                        repeat itself within an object array, preventing extra properties from being
                        allowed to occur beyond the given items in the object arrays is impossible.
                        It successfully prevents improper property types from being validated, but
                        when I add in a new random key-value pair that I did not define within that
                        object, it validates anyways. For example, the <span class="code"
                            >"Tags"</span> object array: </p>
                    <div class="code"> "Tags": { "type": "array", "items": { "language": {"type":
                        "string"}, "text": {"type": "string"}, "public": {"type": "boolean"} } }, </div>
                    <p class="post">The object array <span class="code">"Tags"</span> can have
                        multiple sets of the three items <span class="code">"language", "text",
                            "public"</span>. JSON schema does not provide the option of defining
                        exactly how many times this repetition of items is allowed to occur, and
                        when I input random incorrect key-value items, it validated the code when it
                        should not have. Alan and I had a discussion about this, and by the end of
                        it, Alan and I agreed that JSON schema was simply not the way to go in terms
                        of data validation. For now, since there are already multiple layers of data
                        validation in place when the data is created, Alan feels comfortable going
                        without another layer of validation for now - especially since this project
                        is crunched for time.</p>
                    <p class="post">While we alas are bagging the JSON schema route, I learned a
                        whole lot about JSON and OOP in general in the process of creating this
                        schema, so I'm happy that my work has lead to new discoveries - however
                        unfruitful. I am going to document my JSON schema discoveries, and continue
                        working on the data in new ways that will hopefully be more helpful to the
                        project in the coming weeks. Sorry JSON schema, but you are not Relax-NG,
                        and therefore you stink.</p>

                    <p class="span">Week of 10/19-10/21 - Fourth Week</p>
                    <p class="post"> I am no longer the newest person on the Tech/Software Dev team!
                        We have a new Junior Software Developer and a new Scrum Master. Dan got us
                        Panera Bread for lunch to welcome them, and it was scrumptious. I had a
                        turkey <span class="code">blatvocado</span> sandwich. Scrumptious. This week
                        I've been mostly trying to figure out ways around the limitations presented
                        by JSON schema. If it turns out I can't find any way to write a JSON schema
                        that will meet our data validation needs, I'm going to try writing a
                        Javascript schema instead. I was only able to attend one of the workshops
                        from the week-long Arango Dev Days conference, since most of the talks and
                        panels directly conflicted with my insane schedule. The one workshop I went
                        to was pretty nifty, though. They were talking about AQL and different ways
                        of using Arango to query data. The folks who work for Arango are pretty dang
                        smaht. </p>
                    <p class="post"> The rest of this week's activities included writing up
                        documentation on the process of battle-testing my schemas, how to associate
                        a schema with a collection in Arango, and some other jazz. I'm starting to
                        get the hang of the whole "ticket" and "sprint" workflow situation the Tech
                        team uses. A ticket is a thing you are going to complete by the end of a
                        sprint. A sprint is about two weeks of work. (No, there are no "jogs", as
                        far as I know.) A ticket has multiple sub-tasks that comprise the sprint.
                        When you're done with all of your tickets' sub-tasks, you won the sprint.
                        Then you run around the building real fast yelling "I AM SPEED". That's
                        called a victory lap. I think. Then, before the next sprint, we do a
                        "grooming" meeting, where we go through everybody's tickets for the next
                        sprint, and then everybody votes on the complexity of the ticket and how
                        long they think the ticket is going to take that person or group working on
                        the ticket, using a weird rating scale of 3-13, 3 being super simple and
                        shouldn't take long, 13 being super complex and it'll take a while. Except
                        you can only choose from 3, 5, 8, 13, and 89. If you vote 89, your vote
                        doesn't count because that's a ridiculous number and shame on you for even
                        thinking of pressing that big beautiful number. </p>

                    <p class="post"> Life got weird this week, but work was superb. I finally got to
                        make a branch and push to one of the Arjuna project repositories! Yayyyy. I
                        still can't help sort of feeling like dead weight for my team, because of
                        how little software dev code I know (JS, TS, C++. shiz like that), but I
                        think that might change soon. Alan the Wizard of Code and Things had the
                        fantastic idea of having me do a little side-project homework exploration on
                        Javascript. He suggested that I create a little music album JSON data
                        library to run JS code through. So here's the new plan: Every Wednesday at
                        3:30ish, I go in to Larson after class to meet with him and he teaches me
                        about different ways to use JS functions that are relevant to the Arjuna
                        project, but instead of writing it for the Arjuna project, which is huge and
                        complex and not the easiest for rookies to grasp, he'll show me how to write
                        the code and run it on my little JSON library. I'll be using <a
                            href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to create <span class="code"
                            >get()</span> and <span class="code">post()</span> requests as a client
                        to my music album server. This will give me lotsa practice on
                        backend-developing freeform JS jazz. </p>
                    <p class="post"> Tim sent me a document with some code he wrote for formal
                        grammar rules in the project, using a language he dubbed "Caveman XML"
                        called EBNF - Extended Backus–Naur Form. According to Wikipedia, EBNF is a
                        family of metasyntax notations, any of which can be used to express a
                        context-free grammar. EBNF is used to make a formal description of a formal
                        language such as a computer programming language. Tim wrote some EBNF to
                        establish grammar rules for the learning objects and other things that we
                        will be the building blocks for Arjuna's data. The syntax sort of reminds me
                        of JSON, Relax-NG, REGEX, and XML combined. I think Tim and I are going to
                        set up a meeting next week to talk about the code he wrote, and ways we
                        might be able to implement it into the backend code to establish contexts
                        for our data processsing, validations, and modeling. </p>
                    <p class="post"> We also had a little company lunch at Calamari's this week,
                        which was really fun. (: I got to talk to some coworkers that I hadn't
                        really gotten the chance to talk to before. My social anxiety and general
                        feelings of intimidation are slowly easing day by day. Everybody is just a
                        person, doing their best, learning as they go, same as me. </p>

                        was allowing extraneous objects to occur within the data, outside of those I
                        had listed as properties in the JSON schema. Upon testing the schema I wrote
                        for the <span class="code">scopes</span> collection, I realized something
                        strange. Every time I pasted and saved the entirety of my schema code into
                        the collection's Schema code entry block, each time I navigated away from
                        the page and went back to look at the schema code in Arango, the last
                        portion of my schema code was completely gone - including the last property
                        definition, as well as my <span class="code">required:["...", "...",
                            "..."]</span> and <span class="code">additionalProperties: false</span>
                        parameters at the end of the schema rule. Those parameters, which Arango was
                        automatically deleting, should've prevented any properties outside of those
                        listed in the rule. I was baffled at why Arango was deleting parts of my
                        code - normally, whenever there is a syntax error in the code, Arango simply
                        will not allow you to save the schema, and will throw an error. Neither
                        Arango nor VS Code flagged any portion of my schema as malformed. I then
                        investigated my code to try to understand why Arango would delete whole
                        portions of my code, and made a facepalm-deserving discovery: due to the
                        misplacement of one little curly brace, my schema rule was improperly
                        nested. I had an extra curly brace at the end of my second-to-last schema
                        property rule, which closed the <span class="code">"rule":</span> property
                        which contained all of the rules for the entire schema, instead of just the
                        current property rule node I meant to close. This must be why Arango
                        automatically deleted the following property rules and parameters; it
                        assumed I had finished the code once it hit that extra end-curly brace,
                        disregarding the rest of the nested items. Whoops... <i><b>**facepalm
                                intensifies**</b></i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="post">Once I promptly corrected that silly curly brace mistake in my
                        schema code, I updated the Arango collections for both the competencies and
                        scopes data sets and ran some tests - and it worked! Yay! Sadly, extraneous
                        data inputs are still being validated within object <i>arrays,</i> but the
                        schema now successfully prevents random properties from being validated. I
                        told Alan about it, explaining my little curly brace error, and he was very
                        happy with my discovery. He reassured me that silly little mistakes like
                        that happen to experienced devs all the time, which helped prevent me from
                        facepalming myself into oblivion. Now that I understand better how important
                        the nesting of property items within a JSON schema rule is, I think I might
                        be able to rewrite my schemas to fix the problem of extraneous data inputs
                        within the object arrays... more on that next week. </p>
                    <p class="post"> I now have a new priority: generating iterations of competency
                        data using Tim's EBNF formal grammar rules code, possibly with some natural
                        language processing! I had a meeting with Alan and Tim on Thursday to
                        discuss the grammar rules for the competencies, and we tweaked it a bit to
                        ensure that it would produce succinct and logical sentences when each piece
                        of the grammar web is parsed and strung together with actual competency
                        words and phrases from the Common Core vocabulary, as well as from Larson's
                        textbook lingo. This all came to be when I asked the golden question: "How
                        are these rules going to be implemented into the code?" In short, Alan and
                        Tim have tasked me with re-writing Tim's EBNF in a language I'll be able to
                        run through a natural language processor, and generate real-live competency
                        data to be used in Arjuna's real competency code. This is a pretty big deal
                        for the project overall, so I feel honored that Tim and Alan trust me with
                        this quest! I'm thinking I'll rewrite the EBNF syntax rules in relax-NG, and
                        possibly transform it into something that can be processed through Python to
                        generate iterations of code? I'm definitely looking forward to Dr. B's
                        counsel on this, since she's the natural-language-processing guru. </p>
                    <p class="post"> On the Wednesday software dev training front, we finally got
                        the <span class="code">post()</span> function working in Postman on my JS
                        album server! Now I can hit the ground running and write more JS to allow
                        post requests to save into the body of my JSON album data library, as well
                        as allow for new types of album data (such as release dates, recording
                        studio names, etc.) to be input by the client. Alan walked me through the JS
                        functions which test the validity of the post() input data. Here's a peek: </p>

                    <p class="post"> School and life this week hit me with a metaphysical bag of
                        bricks, but by some miracle, work was still productive... dare I say fun. I
                        pushed those corrections to the data validation schemas for the scopes and
                        competencies data up to the Arjuna BitBucket repository, where I learned
                        something schwifty about git branches and using <span class="code">git
                            log</span> and <span class="code">git diff</span> commands. Since I was
                        working on two separate unmerged branches for the <span class="code"
                            >competencies</span> validation code and the <span class="code"
                            >scopes</span> validation code, I didn't realize I needed to be sure
                        that I switched which branch I was on in the terminal using <span
                            class="code">git checkout [branch-name]</span> to see the updates I made
                        to the other schema. So, as I was working on the scopes schema, when I went
                        to check my competencies schema to compare, I saw that the competencies
                        schema had mysteriously reverted to an older version of itself! (It didn't -
                        I was simply on the scopes branch, which didn't have the updates I made on
                        the competencies schema and main branches on it.) Seeing this, I re-updated
                        my competencies schema code on the scopes branch, and you can probably guess
                        what happened when I tried to merge it to main.<b> *dun dun dunnn*</b> BUT
                        good news was, I didn't totally make everything explode. Bitbucket prevents
                        you from merging a branch if there's a merge conflict afoot, phew. Alan
                        showed me how to use <span class="code">git diff</span> to grab all of the
                        commit IDs from all of the commits which had my scopes schema work on it,
                        but none of the silly misunderstood competencies schema edits - so all I had
                        to do was grab those commits and push them to the main branch, and nuke the
                        problematic conflict branch, and boom. Problem solved. But that's definitely
                        the last time I ever push anything directly into the main branch without a
                        proper branch pull request! </p>

                        managers together in a room for 4 hours runs the inevitable risk of strong
                        opinions flowing over the scheduled meeting end-time. Although, I will say I
                        think I've finally made some decent (albiet bug-ridden) progress on my JSON

                        'Twas a week chock-full of new things, experimentation, and triumph. I worked two full 8-hour days on Tuesday and Wednesday since I had no classes this week for gobble gobble day, and I feel like I got a LOT more accomplished than I normally would have during my usual 5 hour days. I mostly worked on finding ways to generate competency data from our EBNF grammar syntax rules, and I ended up finding this <a href="https://baturin.org/tools/bnfgen/">BNF generator</a> which takes input BNF grammars and generates random sentences based on the rules defined in the BNF grammar. I had to rework our original EBNF to turn it into functinal BNF for the client-side demo input, and once I got it working, it produced a lot of good instances of competency senteces!! I showed this to Tim and Alan, and we made some further adjustments to our original grammar rules to adjust it to what we need for Arjuna's competency data set. We found that in order to generate competencies that are more granular and filtered by domain scopes, we can avoid some illogical productions that would never actually occur in a real competency for the LMS. After I rewrite the umbrella modified_competency into separate competency definitions for each scope, all I need to do is find a way to implement this into code and generate the outputs. I tried to install the bnfgen as an npm module so that I could use their generator locally, but alas, I don't think the developers of that package worked out some major kinks in their bnfgen github repo - nothing worked, and everything threw bug errors. Not even their demo input worked when I ran it, so that was a big red flag. I'm better off just converting all of the end-terminal strings into XML, and then use XQuery to somehow apply our grammar rules to the end terminals and generate some fine-tuned competency string iterations.

                        On the Javascript exploration side of things - we had our Wednesday software development training, and Alan helped me debug my album JSON library server post() request and my doesAlbumExist() function to check that the client isn't pushing duplicate albums into our library. And the post() method finally works! Now, using Postman to simulate client side server interactions, I can write new album data into the library! Woooo. Next, we are going to reconfigure the structure of this album server to emulate Arjuna's project structure by creating a Foxx layer to integrate document and edge collections of album data and album relationship data, which will help me conceptualize what the backend of Arjuna is like.

                        And finally - if you haven't already noticed - my adventures into Javascript at Larson have led me into a JS-3D-exploration-extravaganza. I found something called Three.JS, which is an npm package module which allows you to create 3D environments using just plain-old javascript!! Pretty nifty eh? I'm definitely going to use this to implement my 3D Mayan relic objects from Blender into our DIGIT 400 project side.

                            As I eclipse my 10-week anniversary of my Larson Texts escapade, the bloody Void of Finals, Sleep Deprivation, and Despair swallows me whole. 
                           This week, I explored some different options for generating comeptency sentence data iterations based on Tim's EBNF grammar rules, and I came up with two plausible options: one, to use a python module called <a href="https://www.davekuhlman.org/generateDS.html#the-xml-schema-input-to-generateds">generate.ds</a>, which takes an input XML Schema file and converts the rules specified in that schema to generate python <b>classes,</b> which could then be used to run queries on my XML competency component string data collection and generate iterations based on the grammar-defined python classes. I also considered using either XSLT or XQuery, but these two options both seemed like they may be limited in their capabilities to allow for flexible and effective control over the filtering of component strings by scope domains which require or exclude them. But, I felt optimistic about XSLT due to the great transformation powers it holds, so I wanted to give it a try. Before writing any scripts, I used Tim's Google spreadsheet containing all of the strings for each of the sentence components and coded them in a nested XML hierarchy, nested based on their relative relationships to neighboring sentence components, and whether or not a choice was involved. Here's a peek at the hierarchy, based on our grammar syntax flow:</p>

                           I wanted to try using generate.ds first, because according to the documentation, generating instances of data using this module is highly controllable, which is very important for these competency generations since they need to be able to be filtered and streamlined according to scope attributes. Plus, it seemed more robust than what my current understandings are of the processing powers of XSLT and XQuery for this sort of iteration work. Here's a look at the XML schema I wrote, again based on the syntax rules defined by Tim's EBNF:
